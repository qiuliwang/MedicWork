In this competition, the primary endpoint will be the detection of bounding boxes corresponding to the diagnosis of pneumonia (e.g. lung infection) on chest radiographs, a special 2D high resolution grayscale medical image. Note that pnuemonia is just one of many possible disease processes that can occur on a chest radiograph, and that any given single image may contain 0, 1 or many boxes corresponding to possible pneumonia locations.\n\nMy name is Peter Chang, MD. I am both a radiologist physician and a data scientist / software engineer with machine learning experience. Today, in this Jupyter notebook, we will explore the 2018 RSNA Challenge dataset including underlying data structures, imaging file formats and label types."

In addition, it is apparent here that the original radiographs have been preprocessed for us as follows:\n\n* The relatively high dynamic range, high bit-depth original images have been rescaled to 8-bit encoding (256 grayscales). For the radiologists out there, this means that the images have been windowed and leveled already. In clinical practice, manipulating the image bit-depth is typically done manually by a radiologist to highlight certain disease processes. To visually assess the quality of the automated bit-depth downscaling and for considerations on potentially improving this baseline, consider consultation with a radiologist physician.\n\n* The relativley large original image matrices (typically acquired at >2000 x 2000) have been resized to the data-science friendly shape of 1024 x 1024. For the purposes of this challenge, the diagnosis of most pneumonia cases can typically be made at this resolution. To visually assess the feasibility of diagnosis at this resolution, and to determine the optimal resolution for pneumonia detection (oftentimes can be done at a resolution *even smaller* than 1024 x 1024), consider consultation with a radiogist physician.\n\n## Visualizing An Example\n\nTo take a look at this first DICOM image, let's use the `pylab.imshow()` method:"
